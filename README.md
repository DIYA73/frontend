# Frontend Fundamentals – HTML5 Portfolio

This repository contains a **pure HTML5 portfolio website** created as part of my journey from **Backend Development** into **Frontend fundamentals**.

The goal of this project is **not design or interactivity**, but:
- Clean structure
- Semantic HTML
- Professional project organization

## 👩‍💻 About Me

I am a **Backend Developer** currently expanding my skill set by learning **Frontend fundamentals**.

My main focus areas are:
- Backend architecture
- APIs & server-side logic
- Databases
- Clean integration between backend and frontend layers

This project represents my **first step into frontend**, starting correctly with HTML5 before moving to CSS and JavaScript.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Practice **HTML5 semantic elements**
- Build a **professional portfolio structure**
- Understand how frontend pages are structured before styling
- Prepare for future backend integration (templates, SSR, APIs)

⚠️ **No CSS or JavaScript is used intentionally**.
